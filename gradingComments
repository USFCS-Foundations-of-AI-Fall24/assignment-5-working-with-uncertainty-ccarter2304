Assignment 5 Comments:

sklearn:

new dataset. 5/5

random forest 5/5

GridSearchCV 5/5

Scatterplot 5/5

Belief Networks:

alarm queries 5/5

car queries 5/5

additional node 5/5

HMM:

load 5/5

generate 7/10 - I had to fix your argument processing - 
argparse is much better!

lander models 5/5

forward 10/10

viterbi 10/15
Viterbi crashes:
 hm.viterbi(line)
  File "/Users/cbrooks/courses/Fall24/CS362/student_repos/assignment5/assignment-5-working-with-uncertainty-submissions/assignment-5-working-with-uncertainty-ccarter2304/HMM.py", line 234, in viterbi
    current_index = b[current_index][j] + 1
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str



Utility:

q1 5/5

q2 5/5

q3 1/2 - need to renormalize probabilities.

q4 1/3 - 60%

q5 1/2 - how do we know this?

q6 1/3 - Not really - r1 always looks better, so the satellite is not 
helpful.

86/100
